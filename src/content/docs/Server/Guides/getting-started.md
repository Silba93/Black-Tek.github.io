title: Getting Started
---

We offer a few articles for getting started with BlackTek Server, depending on your needs.

### Compiling

- Manual Compiling Windows
- Manual Compiling Ubuntu

### Preparations required to start the Server

- Setup WebSever
- Setup DatabaseServer
- Setup Account Creator

All 3 things are currently required, make sure you have all installed and configured, as well as running and your config.lua configured for the database connection before attempting to start the server. 

>Server will fail to startup if it fails to connect to the database server

For a more detailed guide on getting everything needed setup and ready to go, like all of the above and more please check out my (_Windows_) tutorial (_with video_) provided [here](https://otland.net/threads/tutorial-blacktek-from-nothing-to-fully-installed-with-aac-on-windows.289572/).


### Connecting to play with server

- Using OTC to connect
- Using 10.98 to connect.

We wish to one day have a client dedicated to BlackTek Server exclusively, until then one of the above are required to connect to, and play on, BlackTek Server.
